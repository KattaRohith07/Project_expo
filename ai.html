                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing various industries by enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and 
                    decision-making capabilities. In manufacturing, AI-driven automation and predictive maintenance optimize production 
                    processes and reduce downtime. Healthcare benefits from AI through advanced diagnostic tools, personalized treatment 
                    plans, and improved patient care. In finance, AI algorithms detect fraudulent activities, automate trading, and provide 
                    personalized financial advice. The retail sector uses AI for inventory management, customer insights, and personalized 
                    marketing. AI also plays a crucial role in transportation with self-driving vehicles and efficient route planning. 
                    Overall, AI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data and learn from it drives innovation and competitiveness across 
                    industries.</p>

                    <h2>Automated system to detect fashion trends</h2>
                    <p>Coolhunter has gained significant importance in the fashion world. They take advantage of social media 
                        platforms to understand new trends in fashion. But, due to irrelevant information, it becomes a challenging
                         task to predict fashion trends. </p>

                    <h2>Fake news detector</h2>
                    <p>In social media, deep fakes, news generators, and fake news have become a menace to society. AI can perform 
                        social responsibility by cross-checking news contents with official government briefings or prestigious news 
                        portals held accountable.</p>

                    <h2>Object detection system</h2>
                    <p>Google Images can classify images based on their contents, such as ‘Birthday’, ‘Pet’, ‘Car,’ ‘Nature’ etc. 
                        On a more complex level, the model can also label the objects in the image. For example, the model can label 
                        all the relevant objects in the image if a human looks at this phone sitting beneath a tree. This is done by 
                        creating an object detection system that skims through the contents of the image. </p>
